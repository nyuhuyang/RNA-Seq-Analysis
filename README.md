I. Introduction

RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline has three sections:

1) STAR-HTSeq.sh<br />
Linux bash shell script including STAR alignment, Samtools sort, HTSeq Count, and Cufflinks

2) Mpileup_Varscan_SnpEff.sh<br />
Lnux bash shell script including Mpileup, Varscan, and SnpEff

3) Annotatedeffvcf-FREQ_summary.R<br />
R code including mutation data clean, FPKM data clean, QC, hclust, and mutation/expression comparison.



II. Outline

  Starting Materials:
  RNA-seq fastq files

  This pipeline is written for 155 WaldenstrÃ¶m Macroglobulinemia (more than one terabyte) RNA-seq data.

  System requirements:
  >40 GB memory high-performance computing (HPC) environment, prefer Sun Grid Engine.
  Linux and Mac OS 64 bit system

  Software requirement:
  R 3.3.2
  python2.7 in server<
