RNA-seq-STAR-alignment-and-HTSeq-Count
Script for STAR alignment and HTSeq Count. 
Used on Linux server in Olivier Elemento lab, at Department of Physiology and Biophysics of Weill Cornell Medicine
•    Process RNA-seq of 155 Waldenström Macroglobulinemia patients in HPC environment (Sun Grid Engine).
•    Debug Linux bash shell script of RNA-Seq workflow including STAR, samtools, HTseq, cufflinks, varscan, etc.
•    Capture somatic mutations from RNA-seq data and compare with gene expression in R.
